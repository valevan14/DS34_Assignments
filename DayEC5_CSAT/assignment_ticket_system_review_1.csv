It's simple and easy to use with straightforward options for even those who are new to using a helpdesk system.Zendesk is basically an email support system, where all emails sent will be routed to your Zendesk dashboard and show up as support tickets. Tickets are tagged with its own ID and even cross-referenced to see if a particular sender has submitted any tickets prior, so it's easy to check through the support history. There are also pre-defined responses, allowing for quick and easy replies for typical queries.Of course, these are actually what you might believe every helpdesk system should provide, but you'll be surprised at how much you have to pay and that some don't even have these options at all. Zendesk is actually very affordable and is easily scalable."

I find that it is a great place to begin adding support for your services if you don't already have support, as it is easy to set up and offers all the minimums you need to get rolling at their free tier. I found that is was great for handling between 0 - 250 requests per day with a few agents, however it got clunkier as we tried to scale this approach toward 500-1000 requests/day. The main issues that we ran into were UI complexity and constantly having to jump around to get things done - whether that was referencing a customer's information in detail or jumping between conversations. It is also important to note that their embeddable support widgets are not the best looking, but their API makes up for it - I strongly recommend you write your own front-end components for this if you intend to operate at scale.Overall, Freshdesk offers a great starting place of you don't have any support service in place and I think it will serve most small to medium companies perfectly."

Not a great fan of cloud base solutions but everyone is jumping on Virtual Servers and Cloud base solutions is like a force movement like me writing this review when Im just evaluating a solution and alternative to G Suites from Google. Workspace from Facebook calls my attention eventhou is also cloud base but is the closes in Features. Just like the Standalone version of Zendesk that we all learn too user the codes and independency of running the software on the local network overpasses any cloud base solution in my opinion. Automations and Macros are great working locally without the need of High bandwith which we can afford in USA but on other locations in the caribean is a luxury even for big business to have the bandwith we have. OOOOhh And what happens at hurricane season? when we had blackouts we still ran the Zendesk locally. An example of such dependency of cloud based systems is the Automations function doesn't flow in a similar way but are timed instead of instantaneous compare to local run version of the software. Macros allow you to update a ticket's tags, message, and other information with a click of a button. Zendesk has done a great job to make a ticketing system and keeping up the standard with the growing number of completion."

"T_04438",2024-12-24,"Jira Service Management",4,0,4,3,4,5,"JSD offers a lot for any company needing to maintain a service desk to manage thesupport requests it handles from its clients/customers. Because it is a Jira (Atalassian) product, it is most likely utilized along with other Jira tools, and plays quite well with those. Due to this integration aspect, thought, the layers of security necessitated within user settings requires a considerable amount of learning/training, which is not easily attained without paying for it from Atalassian. And, while I understand, respect (and even applaud) the market-oriented principle of this, it does seem a bit intentional that there are no reliable helps available outside of Atlassian (for example, any tutorials you will find on YouTube for assisting with certain user configs, settings, steps, etc. are applicable to much older versions of the software, and to a great extent, are not applicable to the current version). This would not be a negative aspect if Jira did a much better job at keeping their own internal (free) help docs, etc. up to date, so as to apply to the current version, as well.Instead, if one wants highly dependable helps it appears the best way to achieve that is to pay Atlassian for their training courses (at prices that are obviously calibrated toward larger companies/corporations. And blindly undertaking such would seem risky if judged by the extent to which their free user tools are kept up to date.This is not, to my knowledge, the common experience with most apps."
